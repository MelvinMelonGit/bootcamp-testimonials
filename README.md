Hi there! Thanks for viewing my solution :)

I have a few questions:

1 - Is it possible to create an infinite scroll with only 2 images? the resources I found were at least 3 images for the slider.

2 - Instead of using display none, what can I do to create a transition animation for the text after switching to the next picture?

3 - How may I improve my code?

Thanks for commenting!
